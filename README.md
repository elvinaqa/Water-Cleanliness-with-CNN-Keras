# Water-Cleanliness-with-CNN-Keras
Image classification problem with Convolutional Neural Networks application, Water Cleanliness with CNN Keras Tensorflow

Model is trained on Google's Teachable Machines platform.

After training the model with 200 epochs, with the batch size of 16 and 0.001 learning rate, model achieved to skyrocket a accuracy score of 99% of strictly clean and strictly dirty images samples collected by us. Data is augmented as well beofre fedding into the neural network in terms of its weight, height, zoom, etc.
